#Description: 

The purpose of this assignment was to build a representation of a keyboard and to find the best steps for a given string. Within my keyMeUp.py program I have created an interactive menu that has 2 options to run, these include silent mode and interactive mode.

#Contents:

keyMeUp.py - main file to run
testKeyMeUp.sh - script that tests command line arguments 
DSAGraph.py - graph functionalities
GraphUnitTest.py - graph test
DSALinkedList.py - linked list
LinkedListUnitTest.py - linked list unit test
DSAQueue.py - queue
QueueUnitTest.py - queue test
DSAStack.py -  stack
StackUnitTest.py -  stack test
Keyboard.py - contains all the menu functions
KeyboardUnitTest.py - test keyboard
myException.py - custom exceptions
Menu.py - interactive menu
MenuUnitTest.py - testing menu
keyboard.txt - keyboard file 1
keyboard.txt - keyboard file 2
keyboard.txt - keyboard file 3
paths.txt - stores the paths into this file then this file is read and sorted
UML.png -uml diagram
README.txt - this file



---------------------------------
To run interactive mode type the following in the terminal and make sure you are in the correct directory:

python3 keyMeUp.py -i 

----------------------------------

To run silent mode type the following in the terminal and also make sure you are in the correct directory:

python3 keyMeUp.py -s keyboard.txt stringfile.txt output.txt
python3 keyMeUp.py -s keyboard2.txt stringfile2.txt output2.txt
python3 keyMeUp.py -s keyboard3.txt stringfile3.txt output3.txt

Silent mode with return a file with paths without having to type anything into interactive mode
